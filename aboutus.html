                                Hello! We are a group of high school students from the Bay Area in California.  Our goal is to inspire other people to become more interested in Science, Technology, And Math Problem Solving (STAMPS). <br><br>

We were a First Lego League Team for five years. We have made it to the World Festival in St. Louis and also have some experience with the Science Olympiad Competition and various math competitions. <br><br>

STAMPS was created to encourage people of all ages to be interested in STEM related topics. Watch our videos for information on a wide variety of topics!

                                We will have video lessons and articles to help teach children about STEM. We provide an intuitive                                   way to learn science, robotics, and math problem solving. We will include breakdowns of a scientific                                 discovery, an in-depth look at how you can design your own robot, and math problem solving                                     videos.

                                STAMPS plans to holds free seminars at community places like libraries and schools to promote STEM. We                                  will hold workshops and classes for hands on learning and tutoring. Our seminars and                                         workshops will first start being held in the Bay Area.

                                The topics we teach here at STAMPS are science, robotics, and math problem solving, the key                                     cornerstones of STEM. We are the first to educate the public on these three aspects through                                     easy to understand yet effective lessons.
